        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pure maple syrup</li>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toss the squash with the oil and a generous pinch each of salt and pepper in a large bowl. Tile the squash slices in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, overlapping the pieces. Stir the maple syrup, orange zest and juice together in a small bowl and pour over the squash.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake 30 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until the squash is tender and the top begins to brown, 30 to 40 minutes more. Scatter the parsley over the top.
